# Title: Affine Cipher Encryption & Decryption

# Description:
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Affine Cipher, an encryption technique that combines both substitution and Caesar Cipher methods. The repository includes scripts for encrypting and decrypting text, an exploration of cryptographic vulnerabilities, and the application of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for modular inverses.

# Key Features:
Encryption and decryption functions
Modular arithmetic utility
Security analysis of the cipher

# Technologies Used:
Python
Mathematical Algorithms
